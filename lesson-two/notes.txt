In here we have a <button> element that we want to make resemble the youtube subscribe buton.

We will add CSS to it.

to do this we use the <style> tag and closing </style> tag.

The <style> tag does not make things appear on the page in a visible manner, 
but they tell the browser how to style the page.


            SYNTAX RULES

    CSS Selector = which elements we're targeting on the page.

    The most basic selector would be something like the following: 
    
        button {
            background-color: red;
        }
    
    Where we are saying "I want all the button elements on the page to have the background color red."

    Inside the {} brackets is a syntax we have to follow.

    Each CSS Property we are going to name has to be followed by a colon on the right, and then a CSS value for that attribute.

    We must terminate these with the semicolon like in Java/C++/etc.

    in our example, background-color is the CSSProperty.

    Techniques to create CSSProperty is done in two steps.

    1. create the element in HTML.
    2. Style it property by property in CSS.

    Pseudo Classes.

    pseudoclasses are given after a : colon in the class name.

    ex:

    :hover describes the way an element should display upon the cursor hovering
    over any element with the subscribe-button class assigned to it.

    .subscribe-button:hover {
        
    }

    :active describes how an element using the class subscribe-button should
    display as it is actively being clicked upon.
    .subscribe-button:active{

    }
