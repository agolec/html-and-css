In here we have a <button> element that we want to make resemble the youtube subscribe buton.

We will add CSS to it.

to do this we use the <style> tag and closing </style> tag.

The <style> tag does not make things appear on the page in a visible manner, 
but they tell the browser how to style the page.


            SYNTAX RULES

    CSS Selector = which elements we're targeting on the page.

    The most basic selector would be something like the following: 
    
        button {
            background-color: red;
        }
    
    Where we are saying "I want all the button elements on the page to have the background color red."

    Inside the {} brackets is a syntax we have to follow.

    Each CSS Property we are going to name has to be followed by a colon on the right, and then a CSS value for that attribute.

    We must terminate these with the semicolon like in Java/C++/etc.

    in our example, background-color is the CSSProperty.
