Pseudo classes.

When we want to add new styles to an element upon a condition like the cursor
hovering over it, or the user clicking it, we make a new style with the following
syntax:

    .<class_name>:<desired_action> {

    }

    ex:

    .subscribe-button:hover {

    }

    :hover is a pseudoclass because we're adding another style to an existing style, 
    if the context of that style is met. In this case, the user has to hover over the
    element using the class subscribe-button, and the styles inside .subscribe-button:hover
    will be applied.

    Hovers

    Transitions

        Shadows

Shadows have attributes like 'box-shadow' which create a shadow matching the shape of the object.
