Pseudo classes.

When we want to add new styles to an element upon a condition like the cursor
hovering over it, or the user clicking it, we make a new style with the following
syntax:

    .<class_name>:<desired_action> {

    }

    ex:

    .subscribe-button:hover {

    }

    :hover is a pseudoclass because we're adding another style to an existing style, 
    if the context of that style is met. In this case, the user has to hover over the
    element using the class subscribe-button, and the styles inside .subscribe-button:hover
    will be applied.

    Hovers

in order to add a hover to any element matching a class, add the :hover pseudo 
class as described above.

    Transitions

Transitions use the arribute 'transition' with a value 'opacity' followed by a duration.

ex:

    transition: opacity 0.15s

You would add these to your class that contains the :hover pseudoclass so that
when the user hovers on the element, it will perform the transition.

        Shadows

Shadows have attributes like 'box-shadow' which create a shadow matching the shape of the object.

we can use rgba() to make shadows.
